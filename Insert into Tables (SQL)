INSERT INTO SELECT
The following SQL statement copies "Suppliers" into "Customers" (fill all columns):

INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
SELECT SupplierName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country FROM Suppliers;

The following SQL statement copies only the German suppliers into "Customers":

INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, City, Country)
SELECT SupplierName, City, Country FROM Suppliers
WHERE Country='Germany';

The following SQL goes through conditions and returns a value when the first condition is met:

SELECT OrderID, Quantity,
CASE
    WHEN Quantity > 30 THEN 'The quantity is greater than 30'
    WHEN Quantity = 30 THEN 'The quantity is 30'
    ELSE 'The quantity is under 30'
END AS QuantityText
FROM OrderDetails;

The following SQL statement creates a stored procedure named "SelectAllCustomers" that selects all records from the "Customers" table

CREATE PROCEDURE SelectAllCustomers
AS
SELECT * FROM Customers
GO;
Execute the stored procedure above as follows:
EXEC SelectAllCustomers;

The following SQL statement creates a stored procedure that selects Customers from a particular City from the "Customers" table:
CREATE PROCEDURE SelectAllCustomers @City nvarchar(30)
AS
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City = @City
GO;

Execute the stored procedure above as follows:

Example
EXEC SelectAllCustomers @City = 'London';

Stored Procedure With Multiple Parameters
Setting up multiple parameters is very easy. Just list each parameter and the data type separated by a comma as shown below.

The following SQL statement creates a stored procedure that selects Customers from a particular City with a particular PostalCode from the "Customers" table:

Example
CREATE PROCEDURE SelectAllCustomers @City nvarchar(30), @PostalCode nvarchar(10)
AS
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City = @City AND PostalCode = @PostalCode
GO;
Execute the stored procedure above as follows:

Example
EXEC SelectAllCustomers @City = 'London', @PostalCode = 'WA1 1DP';


The following SQL will order the customers by City. However, if City is NULL, then order by Country

SELECT CustomerName, City, Country
FROM Customers
ORDER BY
(CASE
    WHEN City IS NULL THEN Country
    ELSE City
END);
